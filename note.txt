- autogeneated .js file has all the necessary code to load a wasm
  - instantiateAsync
    - fetch wasm
      - WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming
        - receiveInstantiationResult  
          - 'result' object contains:   (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiate)
            - module     > WebAssembly.Module object
            - instance   > WebAssembly.Instance object

  - receiveInstance is where the module has finally loaded and 



  - _malloc, _free
    - Needed to add -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS=['_malloc','_free'] when executing emcc to make these available on 'Module' object
      (don't remember having to do this when compiling mss_compute.cpp, so no sure what the difference was)

  - getValue, setValue  (global)
    - briefly I did not see those set on window, not sure what the condition was to cause this, seems ok now, though...
